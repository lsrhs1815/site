    <h2> You aren't gonna go up to a crazed clown and rip a paper out of their hair, the will kill you so why not tell your friends they will get it they want to get out just as much as you, so you tell them, but they don't see it and think you are crazy then when they finally see it, they won't go get it, they tell you to get it since you saw it first. They won't back down so you have no choice but to go and grab the clue. As you are making your way to the clown it notices you and starts coming your way, wielding the knife. You run as fast as you can and jump to the side grabbing the clue at the same time and just miss totally ramming into the clown. You book it back to your friends and go to look at the clue, when you open up the piece of paper you see a picture of a picture of a unicycle and a big bow, confused you look up at your friends and around the room, then you see it, a unicycle far in front of you a little to the right, you are about to tell your friends when you notice them looking at something else, sure enough they are looking at  big bow laying on the ground in the total other direction of the unicycle do you
