    <h2> You think that nothing really bad can come through a colorful door, maybe it's for young kids who wanted to believe they could brave a big bad scary haunted house but no, when you walk in there is blood and flowers everywhere, the smell of caramel fills your nose, and the sounds of horrible high pitched ear shattering laughs and screams fill your ears, you see fat figures with big poofy hair in the distance, what do you do? </h2>
